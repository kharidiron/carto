# Carto
Really basic web (HTMl/CSS/JS) implementation of the Cartographers[^1] boardgame score sheet.

Note - I designed this with small screens/mobile devies in mind. It acts a bit wonky when used on a desktop browser due to flex-box stretching.

## CYA / CMA
I make now claims on the game itself. I simply wanted a way to play it on the go that didn't require me having to carry paper and a writing implement. One still needs to own the game cards to play.

I also make no promises on the code. It was thrown together one evening and lacks a lot of validation/sanity checking. Use at your own risk/don't refresh your browser page if you don't want to lose your porgress. (I might someday try to make this better with local cacheing or something... but that seems a bit over-the-top at this point).
